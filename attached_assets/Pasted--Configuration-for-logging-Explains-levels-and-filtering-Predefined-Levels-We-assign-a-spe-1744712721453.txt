Configuration for logging. Explains levels and filtering.

Predefined Levels: We assign a specific logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to each logger call in the code based on the type of event we expect that message to represent.
    logger.info("Starting step X") - Normal progress.
    logger.debug(f"Calculated factor = {value}") - Detailed internal value, useful for deep debugging.
    logger.warning("Overlap is small, results might be affected") - Something unexpected happened, but the code can continue, possibly with reduced accuracy.
    logger.error("File not found") - A significant error occurred that prevents a step from completing correctly, but the program might try to continue or fail gracefully.
    logger.critical("Cannot allocate memory, exiting") - A fatal error preventing the program from continuing at all.

Filtering by Configuration: When we run the program, we set a minimum logging level in main.py via log_config.setup_logging(level=...).
    If we set level=logging.INFO, the logger will process and output (to the file in our case) all messages logged with level INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. It will ignore any messages logged with DEBUG.
    If we set level=logging.DEBUG, the logger will process and output all messages from DEBUG up to CRITICAL.

Analogy: Think of it like setting a volume control for your logs.

    Writing logger.debug(...) in the code is like recording a very quiet whisper.
    Writing logger.info(...) is like recording normal speech.
    Writing logger.warning(...) is like recording a shout.
    Writing logger.error(...) is like recording an alarm bell.

When you run the script, log_config.setup_logging(level=...) sets the playback volume threshold.
    level=logging.INFO means "only play back normal speech and louder (shouts, alarms)". Whispers (DEBUG) are ignored.
    level=logging.DEBUG means "play back everything, from whispers to alarms".

    documentation generation tools (like Sphinx). Writing good docstrings is a crucial part
    of writing maintainable and understandable Python code
